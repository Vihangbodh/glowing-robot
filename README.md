# glowing-robot
My own implementation of an RSA-based digital signature generator, SHA512 hashing algorithm, and an AES symmetric cipher
 - The file `glowing_signature.py` contains all codes required for working with RSA-based digital signatures (use the function `demo_everything()` to see how it works).
 - The file `glowing_hash.py` contains all codes required to generate a SHA512 hash of any string you provide (use the function `demo_everything()` to see how it works).
  - New: The file `glowing_aes.py` contains an implementation of the AES encryption system (use the function `demo_everything()` to see how it works).
